SUMMARY OF DATA:
Shot locations and outcomes for selected Ivy League men's basketball games
All conference games available for the 2015-16 Ivy League men's basketball season
Selected games available for 2016-17 and 2017-18


DESCRIPTION OF FIELDS:
DATE = date of game (m/d/yyyy)
HALF = half of game (3=OT1, 4=OT2...)
TEAM = shooting team
OPPONENT = defending team
TIMEREMAINING = time remaining in half (approximate)
PLAYERID = jersey number of shooter
MAKEMISS = outcome of shot: 1=make, 0=miss, 2=shooting foul

XINT = recorded x-coordinate of shot location, parallel to baseline (in feet, 0 = center of court)
YINT = recorded y-coordinate of shot location, parallel to sideline (in feet, 0 = even with basket)
	NOTE: see included image for x-y coordinates
DISTANCE = approximate distance of shot (DISTANCE = SQRT(X^2 + Y^2))

X = plotted location of x-coordinate, offset by random variance of +/- 0.5
Y = plotted location of y-coordinate, offset by random variance of +/- 0.5
	NOTE: Use these for graphing (to avoid 'clustering' at integer marks)
	      Use INT, YINT for analysis (avoid random variation)


NOTES ON 2016 DATA:
-First half of Dartmouth at Princeton missing because video unavailable
-Few shots in first half of Harvard at Yale missing because replay unavaliable
-Data is manually logged from watching game tape, may not be 100% accurate

NOTES ON 2017 DATA:
-Few second-half shot locations of Columbia at Princeton are guesses (video cutting in and out)
-First 17:00 of Penn at Yale missing (video unavailable)
